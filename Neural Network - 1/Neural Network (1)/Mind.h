 @brief This is the header file where the super-code is contained.
 
 The following  properties are allocated once during initializtion, in order to prevent frequent
 memory allocations for temporary variables during the update and backpropagation cycles.
 Some known properties are computed in advance in order to to avoid casting, integer division
 and modulus operations inside loops.
 
 There are also methods declared in this file. Refer to their documentations.

#pragma mark - Instance Methods

/*!
 @brief This is the constructor for the neural network.
 
 @param inputs number of inputs
 @param hidden number of hidden neurons
 @param outputs number of outpus
 @param learningRate the learning rate of the network, a good start is 0.7
 @param momentum the momentum of the learing, play around with this number, a good estimate is
 @param weights initialize the network with weights from other network or from the past. If initializing new network, set it as null
 
 @return instancetype
 
 @discussion This is a comprehensive constructor. Further improve this parameter so that it can reinitialize neural networks from the past. Also be able to add multiple hidden layers in the middle.
